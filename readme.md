Importing Dependencies: The code imports necessary libraries and modules, including Streamlit, dotenv, and various modules from the langchain package.

Function Definitions:

get_website_text(website_url): Retrieves text content from a given website URL using a sitemap loader.
get_text_chunks(text): Splits the input text into smaller chunks.
get_vectorstore(text_chunks): Creates a vector store from the given text chunks.
get_conversation_chain(vectorstore): Creates a conversation chain using a language model and a vector store.
handle_userinput(user_question): Handles user input and generates a response using the conversation chain.
main() Function: The main function of the Streamlit application. It sets up the Streamlit page configuration, defines the UI elements, and handles user interactions.

Streamlit UI:

The Streamlit application's UI is set up using various Streamlit functions, such as st.header, st.text_input, st.button, and st.spinner.
The user's question is obtained from the text input box, and the handle_userinput function is called to process the question and generate a response.
The sidebar contains a text input box to enter the sitemap URL, and a "Process" button to initiate the text processing flow.
Execution: The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the main() function is executed when the script is run directly.

Note: The code includes commented-out lines and imports that may need to be uncommented or removed depending on the requirements of your project. Additionally, the documentation assumes familiarity with the langchain package, as the details of its usage are not provided.
